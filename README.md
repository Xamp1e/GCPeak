# GCPeak: Quantify GC-spike chromosomes based on genomic sequences #

![alt text](https://github.com/Xamp1e/GCPeak/blob/main/icon.png)

GCPeak is a method for quantifying the variation of GC content at the tips of chromosomes and provide a overall extent of how serious the variation is in one species.

## Usage ##

Simply provide the accession number of Genebank or Refseq, and GCPeak would calculate the GC content with a user-provided window size. After that, the R package Changepoint would be used for determining the distance from the end of chromosome
